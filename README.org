** Download Binary Release 

 - Download: [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caiorss/fxqrcode/gh-pages/fxqrcode.jar][fxqrcode.jar]]

** Building instructions 

This application requires [[https://github.com/caiorss/jarget][jarget]] app and scala compiler as building
dependencies. 

The jarget app can be donwload with: 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh 
$ curl -o ~/bin/jarget -L https://github.com/caiorss/jarget/raw/v2.1.0-beta-release/jarget && chmod +x ~/bin/jarget 
#+END_SRC

Then to build run:

 - =$ make force && make sh=

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ make force && make guard 
  jarget exec com.google.zxing/core/2.2,com.google.zxing/javase/2.2 -- scalac src/main.scala src/qrcode.scala -d bin/fxqrcode.jar
